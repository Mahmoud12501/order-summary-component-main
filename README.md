# Frontend Mentor Order Summary Component
![order-summary-component-main](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This repository contains my solution for the Frontend Mentor "Order Summary Component" challenge. The challenge involved creating a responsive and visually appealing order summary component using HTML and CSS.

In this project, I implemented the design provided by Frontend Mentor, which included a card-like layout with a product image, order details, and a call-to-action button. The challenge required attention to detail and the ability to accurately translate a design into code.
## Key Features:
- Responsive layout: The order summary component is designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- Semantic HTML structure: I followed best practices for structuring HTML elements, ensuring accessibility and search engine optimization.
- CSS styling: I used CSS to style the component, focusing on visual elements such as colors, typography, and spacing.
- Flexbox/Grid: I utilized Flexbox or CSS Grid to create a responsive and flexible layout for the component.
- Cross-browser compatibility: The code has been tested across major web browsers to ensure consistent rendering and functionality.
Feel free to explore the code and the implementation to gain insights into how I approached the challenge and how I organized my HTML and CSS files.
